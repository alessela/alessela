### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer with experience in Java Spring, Angular, React, SQL and Progress OpenEdge. I thrive in Agile environments, working with teams to create scalable and efficient applications.

At Wayfare, I worked on RESTful APIs, responsive web designs and got deployment skills with Docker and CI/CD. I previously worked at AXON-Soft, where I developed Java Spring apps and polished my unit testing skills.

I am always ready to learn and grow, I enjoy problem solving, performance optimization and being current on the latest technology.
